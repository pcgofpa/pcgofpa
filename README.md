### About
<p>
The majority of my work that will appear on Github will be in Python, as I am currently working on teaching Python to my daughter. My current position as a Junior Software Engineer is working on converting Ada to C++ embedded code, and my primary focus is testing the software to ensure that it operates as intended. In addition to performing testing of the software, I do a lot of work with requirements working with SysML and UML in Cameo Enterprise Architecture. 
<br><br>
My primary programming languages are
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
</ul> 
<br>
I have experience working on: 
<ul>
    <li>Applications</li>
    <li>Mobile Development</li>
    <li>Data ETL, Analysis, and Visualization</li>
    <li>Embedded</li>    
</ul>
